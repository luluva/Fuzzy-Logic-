# System for Balance Control

The system consists of the implementation of the fuzzy logic from the IDE of the arduino, where the specific rules for the stabilization of the system, with their respective input and output values, are presented, which is determined by a potentiometer that specifies the reference values, depending on whether it increases or decreases its value.

This stabilizing circuit will be able to reestablish the equilibrium point regardless of the reference value by fuzzy logic, which will allow you to perform the respective calculations through the rules proposed for its correct operation.
